## High-Level Design Overview

This project, freelancer-ceph-k8s, integrates Ceph and Kubernetes to provide a scalable and reliable storage solution for containerized applications. Ceph is a distributed storage system that ensures data redundancy and fault tolerance by distributing data across multiple nodes in a cluster. Kubernetes, on the other hand, is a container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

### Key Components
- **Ceph**: Acts as the underlying storage backend, providing block, file, and object storage capabilities.
- **Kubernetes**: Manages the deployment and scaling of containerized applications, ensuring high availability and resource efficiency.
- **Integration Layer**: Connects Ceph and Kubernetes, enabling seamless communication and data storage operations between the two systems.

### Workflow
1. Containers running on Kubernetes interact with Ceph storage resources through persistent volumes.
2. Ceph ensures data replication and distribution across the cluster to prevent data loss.
3. Kubernetes dynamically scales the application based on resource demands, leveraging Ceph's scalable storage backend.
